            <ol>
                <li>
                    Visit the domain that you would like to disable automatic
                    gain control on. For example, to disable the gain control
                    for Google Meet, visit <a href="https://meet.google.com">
                        https://meet.google.com</a>. (Ensure that you're logged
                    in, so it doesn't redirect you to a different origin.)
                </li> 
                <li>
                    Click on "Disable Automatic Gain Control" in the extensions
                    list.
                    <p><img src="images/pre-enablement.png" /></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    It will request permission to access the site.
                    <p><img src="images/permission-request.png" /><p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the permission is granted, the page will refresh and
                    the icon in the extensions list will show a badge which
                    reflects that the extension is activated.
                    <p><img src="images/post-enablement.png" /></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    To disable the extension on the domain again, simply select
                    the "Disable Automatic Gain Control" extension from the list
                    again. It will refresh the page and the "On" badge will
                    disappear.
