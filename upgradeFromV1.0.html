                Hello! Thanks for being an early user of my extension!
                <b>I've updated the extension in a way that might affect your
                usage.</b> Read about the <a href="usage.html">usage of the new
                version of the extension</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="differences">
                This version of the extension can be enabled on <i>any</i>
                website, not just Google Meet or Hangouts. As a result, you may
                find that <b>Google Meet and Hangouts are not enabled by default
                </b> (as they were in the previous version). If you would like
                to re-enable these websites immediately, you can click the
                button below.
            </p>
            <button id="enable-meet-hangouts-button">Enable Google Meet and Hangouts</button>
